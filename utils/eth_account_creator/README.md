# Ethereum Account Creator

Docker-based utility for generating Ethereum wallet accounts with their corresponding private and public keys.

## Overview

This tool generates Ethereum wallet accounts using cryptographically secure random number generation, producing private keys, public keys, and Ethereum addresses. Each account's information is stored in separate files within a uniquely named directory. The application is containerized with Docker for easy deployment and cross-platform compatibility.

The Ethereum Account Creator leverages the secp256k1 elliptic curve cryptography, which is the same cryptographic algorithm used by the Ethereum blockchain. It produces cryptographically secure random private keys, derives the corresponding public keys, and calculates the Ethereum addresses using the Keccak-256 hashing algorithm. This process ensures that the generated accounts are compatible with all Ethereum-based applications and services.

Each time you run the application, it creates a new Ethereum account with unique cryptographic keys. The keys are stored in a directory named after the last 8 characters of the Ethereum address, making it easy to identify and organize multiple accounts. This naming convention also provides a quick visual reference to distinguish between different accounts without revealing the entire address.

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Run the account generation script:

```bash
.\docker\run.bat
```

4. When prompted, enter the number of Ethereum accounts you want to create
5. Find the generated accounts in the `build/` directory

## How It Works

The application performs the following steps to generate each Ethereum account:

1. Generates a cryptographically secure random 32-byte private key
2. Derives the public key from the private key using elliptic curve cryptography (secp256k1)
3. Hashes the public key using Keccak-256 to obtain the Ethereum address
4. Creates a directory named after the last 8 characters of the address
5. Stores the private key, public key, and address in separate files within the directory

The `run.bat` script orchestrates this process by:
- Building the Docker image containing the Rust application
- Asking how many accounts to generate
- Running the Docker container the specified number of times
- Each container execution generates one Ethereum account

## Outputs

For each account, the following files are generated in a subdirectory of the `build/` directory:

- `.prv`: Contains the private key in hexadecimal format (prefixed with 0x)
- `.pub`: Contains the public key in hexadecimal format (prefixed with 0x)
- `.address`: Contains the Ethereum address in hexadecimal format (prefixed with 0x)

The subdirectory itself is named after the last 8 characters of the Ethereum address.

## Security Considerations

The Ethereum accounts generated by this tool are cryptographically secure and can be used for real transactions on the Ethereum network. However, please be aware of the following security considerations:

1. The private keys are stored as plain text files. Anyone with access to these files will have full control of the associated Ethereum accounts.
2. For production use, consider implementing additional security measures such as encryption of the private keys.
3. Back up your private keys securely if you plan to use these accounts for storing valuable assets.

## Example

1. Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the project directory
2. Run the batch file: `.\docker\run.bat`
3. When prompted "How many Ethereum accounts do you want to create?", enter: `3`
4. The script will create three Ethereum accounts, displaying progress as it goes
5. Navigate to the `build/` directory to find three subdirectories, each named after the last 8 characters of an Ethereum address
6. In each subdirectory, you'll find the `.prv`, `.pub`, and `.address` files containing the account's cryptographic information
