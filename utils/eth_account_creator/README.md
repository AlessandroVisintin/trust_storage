# Ethereum Account Generator

This Docker-based Rust program generates Ethereum accounts, including private keys, public keys, and addresses, based on provided account names. It uses the secp256k1 elliptic curve cryptography and Keccak-256 hashing to create secure and unique Ethereum accounts.

## Features

- Generates multiple Ethereum accounts based on provided account names
- Creates private keys, public keys, and Ethereum addresses
- Outputs the generated keys and addresses to separate files
- Organizes output files in directories named after each account
- Runs in a Docker container for easy deployment and isolation

## Requirements

- Docker
- Docker Compose

## Input

The program requires the following input:

1. **ACCOUNTS** environment variable: A comma-separated list of account names for which to generate Ethereum accounts.

This is set in the `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
environment:
    ACCOUNTS: node0,node1
```

## Output

For each account name provided, the program generates the following files in the `./.output/<account_name>/` directory on the host machine:

1. `.prv`: Contains the private key in hexadecimal format, prefixed with "0x"
2. `.pub`: Contains the public key in hexadecimal format, prefixed with "0x"
3. `.address`: Contains the Ethereum address in hexadecimal format, prefixed with "0x"

## Usage

1. Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository containing the Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml.
3. Modify the `ACCOUNTS` environment variable in the `docker-compose.yml` file if you want to change the account names:

```yaml
environment:
    ACCOUNTS: account1,account2,account3
```

4. Build and run the Docker container using Docker Compose:

```sh
docker-compose up
```

5. The program will create directories for each account name under the `./.output` directory on your host machine and generate the corresponding key and address files.

## Example Output

After running the program with the default `ACCOUNTS="node0,node1"`, you should see the following directory structure in your project folder:

```sh
.output/
├── node0/
│ ├── .prv
│ ├── .pub
│ └── .address
└── node1/
├── .prv
├── .pub
└── .address
```

Each file will contain the respective key or address in hexadecimal format, prefixed with "0x".

## Docker Configuration

The application uses a multi-stage Docker build:

1. The first stage uses the official Rust image to build the application.
2. The second stage uses a minimal `distroless/cc` image to run the compiled binary.

This approach results in a smaller final image and improved security by not including unnecessary components.

## Security Considerations

- The private keys generated by this program are sensitive information. Ensure that the output directory and files have appropriate access permissions.
- For production use, consider implementing additional security measures, such as encryption of the private key files.
- The Docker container runs as a non-root user for improved security.

## Note

This program is designed for educational and testing purposes.
